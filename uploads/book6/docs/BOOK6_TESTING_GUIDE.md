# 📚 Book 6 Testing & Word Replacement Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for testing Book 6 words and implementing word replacement solutions. The system includes automated testing, quality analysis, and interactive word replacement tools.

## 📋 Quick Start

### 1. Run Complete Test Suite
```bash
node run_book6_tests.js
```
This runs all tests including data validation, quality analysis, and functionality tests.

### 2. Start Interactive Word Replacement Interface
```bash
node word_replacement_interface.js
```
This launches a user-friendly menu system for managing word replacements.

### 3. Run Quality Analysis Only
```bash
node data_quality_analyzer.js
```
This analyzes Book 6 data for quality issues and generates detailed reports.

## 🛠️ Word Replacement Solutions

### Solution 1: Individual Word Replacement

```javascript
const { WordReplacementManager } = require('./word_replacement_manager.js');

const manager = new WordReplacementManager();

// Replace a specific word
const newWord = {
    word: 'replacement_word',
    partOfSpeech: 'n',
    meaning: 'A replacement word with better meaning',
    example: 'This is a better example sentence.',
    reason: 'Improving word quality'
};

const success = manager.replaceWord('1', 0, newWord);
```

### Solution 2: Batch Replacement

```javascript
// Replace multiple words in a unit
const replacements = [
    {
        wordIndex: 0,
        newWord: {
            word: 'better_word1',
            partOfSpeech: 'adj',
            meaning: 'Improved meaning 1',
            example: 'Better example 1.',
            reason: 'Batch improvement'
        }
    },
    {
        wordIndex: 1,
        newWord: {
            word: 'better_word2',
            partOfSpeech: 'n',
            meaning: 'Improved meaning 2',
            example: 'Better example 2.',
            reason: 'Batch improvement'
        }
    }
];

const successCount = manager.replaceWordsInUnit('1', replacements);
```

### Solution 3: Find and Replace by Criteria

```javascript
// Find words with missing examples and replace them
const criteria = { missingExample: true };
const newWord = {
    word: 'improved_word',
    partOfSpeech: 'v',
    meaning: 'An improved word with example',
    example: 'This word has a proper example.',
    reason: 'Adding missing examples'
};

const replacedCount = manager.findAndReplace(criteria, newWord);
```

### Solution 4: Interactive Replacement

```bash
# Start the interactive interface
node word_replacement_interface.js

# Follow the menu options:
# 1. Find and review words
# 2. Replace individual word
# 3. Batch replace words in unit
# 4. Find and replace by criteria
# 5. View replacement statistics
# 6. Manage backups
# 7. Export replacement log
```

## 📊 Quality Analysis Features

### Automated Quality Checks

1. **Missing Examples Detection**
   - Identifies words with "Example not provided."
   - Suggests adding meaningful examples

2. **Duplicate Word Detection**
   - Finds words that appear multiple times
   - Suggests synonyms or removal

3. **Formatting Consistency**
   - Checks for extra spaces
   - Validates capitalization
   - Ensures proper punctuation

4. **Part of Speech Validation**
   - Verifies valid POS tags
   - Suggests corrections

5. **Meaning Quality Assessment**
   - Checks for very short/long meanings
   - Identifies missing definitions

### Quality Reports

Reports are generated in multiple formats:
- **JSON**: Detailed structured data
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet-friendly format
- **Console**: Real-time feedback

## 🔄 Backup and Recovery

### Automatic Backup System

- **Before each replacement**: Automatic backup created
- **Backup location**: `backups/book6_backup_TIMESTAMP.json`
- **Backup management**: List, restore, and delete backups

### Recovery Process

```javascript
// List available backups
const backups = manager.listBackups();

// Restore from backup
const success = manager.restoreFromBackup(backupPath);
```

## 📈 Statistics and Monitoring

### Replacement Statistics

- Total replacements made
- Units affected
- Replacement reasons
- Recent replacement history

### Performance Metrics

- Data loading time
- Search performance
- Replacement operation speed

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Quality Check

```bash
# Run quality analysis
node data_quality_analyzer.js

# Review the generated report
# Address high-priority issues first
```

### Example 2: Replace Problematic Words

```bash
# Start interactive interface
node word_replacement_interface.js

# Choose option 1: Find and review words
# Search for words with missing examples
# Replace them one by one or in batch
```

### Example 3: Batch Improvement
