# 4000 Essential English Words - Flashcard App

A comprehensive flashcard application for learning the 4000 Essential English Words series, featuring both local storage and repository persistence.

## Features

- **Study Mode**: Flip through flashcards to learn new words
- **Practice Mode**: Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions
- **Review Mode**: Review mistakes from practice sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your learning progress across all books and units
- **Repository Storage**: Save flashcards to a persistent repository
- **Offline Support**: Continue learning even when repository is unavailable
- **ðŸ”’ Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate words from being created

## Repository Functionality

The app now includes a backend repository system that automatically saves each newly created flashcard to a persistent storage. This ensures your flashcards are safely stored and can be accessed across different devices.

### Repository Features

- **Automatic Saving**: Each new flashcard is automatically saved to the repository
- **Data Persistence**: Flashcards are stored in a JSON file on the server
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time repository connection status
- **Statistics**: View repository statistics including total flashcards and last update time
- **Search Capability**: Search flashcards by word, meaning, or example
- **Book/Unit Filtering**: Filter flashcards by book and unit
- **ðŸ”’ Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate words across all devices

## ðŸ”„ Git Synchronization

The app supports Git-based synchronization for cross-device flashcard sharing:

### Git Sync Features

- **Automatic Commits**: Each new flashcard is automatically committed to Git
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Pull the repository on any device to get the latest flashcards
- **Version Control**: Track changes and revert if needed
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can contribute to the same flashcard collection
- **Manual Sync**: Use the "Sync Git" button for manual synchronization
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time Git status display

### Quick Git Setup

1. **Initialize Git repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Create remote repository** on GitHub/GitLab

3. **Connect to remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Start the server** - Git sync will work automatically!

For detailed setup instructions, see [GIT_SETUP.md](GIT_SETUP.md).

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Development

For development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Repository API Endpoints

The server provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/flashcards` - Get all flashcards
- `POST /api/flashcards` - Save a new flashcard (with duplicate checking)
- `PUT /api/flashcards/:id` - Update an existing flashcard
- `DELETE /api/flashcards/:id` - Delete a flashcard
- `GET /api/flashcards/search` - Search flashcards
- `GET /api/flashcards/check/:word` - Check if a word exists
- `GET /api/stats` - Get repository statistics

## ðŸ”’ Duplicate Prevention

The app now includes comprehensive duplicate word prevention to ensure data integrity:

### Features

- **Local Checking**: Prevents duplicate words within the same application session
- **Repository Checking**: Prevents duplicate words across all devices via the repository
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows word availability status as you type
- **Case-insensitive Matching**: "Hello" and "hello" are treated as duplicates
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Works offline and handles server connection issues
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Clear color-coded feedback for different states

### How It Works

1. **As You Type**: Real-time checking shows if a word is available or already exists
2. **Before Saving**: Double-check prevents duplicate submission
3. **Cross-Device**: Repository ensures no duplicates across different devices
4. **User Feedback**: Clear messages explain why a word cannot be saved

### Testing

Open `duplicate-test.html` in your browser to test the duplicate prevention features without needing the server running.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Book**: Choose from Book 3-6 (Pre-Intermediate to Advanced levels)
2. **Select a Unit**: Each book contains 30 units with 20 words each
3. **Study Mode**: 
   - Click on empty word slots to add new flashcards
   - Fill in the word, part of speech, meaning, and example
   - The app will prevent duplicate words automatically
   - Click "Save Word" to save to both local storage and repository
4. **Practice Mode**: Test your knowledge with generated questions
5. **Review Mistakes**: Review incorrect answers from practice sessions
6. **Progress**: Monitor your learning progress and repository statistics

## Repository Status

The app displays the repository connection status in the header:
- **Connected** (Green): Repository is available and working
- **Disconnected** (Red): Repository server is not available
- **Error** (Yellow): Repository server is available but experiencing issues

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Flashcards are cached in browser localStorage for offline access
- **Repository**: Flashcards are permanently stored in `flashcards_repository.json`
- **Synchronization**: The app automatically syncs data between local storage and repository

## File Structure

```
flashcard/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main application interface
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # Application styling
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js              # Frontend application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ data.js             # Initial vocabulary data
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js           # Backend repository server
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Node.js dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ flashcards_repository.json  # Repository data (created automatically)
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Storage**: JSON file-based repository with localStorage backup
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Repository Connection Issues

1. **Check Server**: Ensure the Node.js server is running (`npm start`)
2. **Check Port**: Verify the server is running on port 3000
3. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in browser console
4. **Offline Mode**: The app works offline with localStorage backup

### Data Loss Prevention

- Flashcards are automatically saved to both localStorage and repository
- If repository is unavailable, data is still saved locally
- Repository data is automatically loaded when connection is restored
